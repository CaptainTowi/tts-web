# Todo List for Web App Development

## Phase 2: Plan web app architecture and features
- [ ] Define core functionalities (file upload, parsing, TTS playback)
- [ ] Outline high-level architecture (frontend, backend considerations)
- [ ] List required technologies/libraries (HTML, CSS, JS, parsing libs, TTS APIs)
- [ ] Consider UI/UX elements (player controls, file selection, progress display)

## Phase 3: Research document parsing libraries and text-to-speech APIs
- [x] Research JavaScript libraries for parsing TEXT, EPUB, PDF, MOBI, DOCX, HTML
    - EPUB: `epub-parser`
    - PDF: `PDF.js`
    - MOBI: `Javascript-MOBI`
    - DOCX: `mammoth.js`
- [x] Research Web Speech API or other TTS APIs for browser-based text-to-speech
    - TTS: Web Speech API

## Phase 4: Create web app structure and UI design
- [x] Set up basic HTML structure
- [x] Design CSS for layout and styling
- [x] Create UI elements for file upload, playback controls, and content display

## Phase 5: Implement document parsing functionality
- [x] Implement file upload handling
- [x] Integrate and use parsing libraries for each document type
- [x] Extract text content from parsed documents

## Phase 6: Implement text-to-speech functionality
- [x] Integrate TTS API
- [x] Implement playback controls (play, pause, stop, seek)
- [x] Handle different voices and languages

## Phase 7: Test and refine the web app
- [x] Conduct unit testing for parsing and TTS modules
- [x] Perform integration testing of the entire application
- [x] Gather user feedback and refine UI/UX

## Phase 8: Deploy and deliver the web app to user
- [ ] Prepare for deployment
- [ ] Deploy the web app
- [ ] Provide instructions and access to the user
